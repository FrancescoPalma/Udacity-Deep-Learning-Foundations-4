Project 4
  
*INTRO*: In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.
  
*SOLUTION*: The solution - with code and detailed comments - is available as HTML file to run in any browser and/or as Jupyter Notebook.
